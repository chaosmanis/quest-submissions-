DAY 2 -- Quest 
  1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
    Safety and Security - Clarity - Approachability - Developer Experience - Resource Oriented Programming 
    
  2. I think the pillars represent what we all want out of something we truly trust to be legit and legal - safe and secure, in and out, no hiccups.
    Clarity in knowing that we can clearly understand what we are looking at and its written intentions. Being approachable, like life, you need to be 
    ok with taking something on or in.. Developer experience is key cause you dont wanna mess around for hour wrestling with something thats gonna take you
    away from a better idea or become frustrating.
